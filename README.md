# Social-Distancing-monitor-for-COVID-19-and-Performance-improvement

During this COVID-19, it is very important to maintain social distance to break the chain of virus.Through this project,we can monitor if persons are following social distancing or not. 
The main idea behind this project is to check the distance between the persons. 
This distance can be calculated using the coordinates of bounding box of the detected person using centroid-tracking algorithm.
If the distance is less than a pre-defined threshold value, then it shows red which means persons are close to each other.
If the distance is greater than the threshold value, then it shows green. 

Performance improvement using OpenVINO tool kit.
